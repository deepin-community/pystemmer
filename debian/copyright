Comment:
 It was inspired by an earlier implementation of PyStemmer (version 0.10, which
 was copyright (c) 2001, Andreas Jung, and also licensed under the MIT license,
 but no portions of which remain in this package, and had a different API).
 .
 Both Andreas Jung's implementation and this implementation are covered by the
 MIT license.
